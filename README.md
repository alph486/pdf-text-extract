# pdf-text-extract
Perl PDF text extractor tool.

This project was forked from http://bitbucket.org/d20pfsrd/extractifier.

```
Usage: PDF_extract [OPTIONS] <INPUT_FILE>
  The extractifier translates PDF input into HTML output using the pdftohtml
  utility as a back end, and performs some janitorial purposes with the
  resulting output.
      -h            display this help information and exit
      -f P          specify an (optional) starting page number in the PDF
                    # broken by for loop iterator
      -l P          specify an (optional) ending page number in the PDF
      -s            specify simplified output
                    # may be subject to change if it should be default
```

# Contributing
I'm not a Perl developer, but I found this a useful script and wanted to open it up on github. If you'd like to make fixes or add features, feel free to fork or submit pull requests.
